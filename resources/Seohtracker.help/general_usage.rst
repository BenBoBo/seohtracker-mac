=============
General usage
=============

Seohtracker is very simple to use. On the left of the main application window
you can see the list of measurements you have taken over time. To its right
there is a graph plotting the measurements. Below the measurement list there is
a minus and plus button to remove and add entries.

By pressing the plus button at the bottom you will be asked to enter the weight
and date of a new measurement. After accepting the dialog the new entry will
appear in the measurements list. If you need to change a measurement, select it
on the list and use the modification button on the right of the main
application window.

You can also click on the graph displayed to the right, which will select the
nearest measurement on the list. Selecting manually an entry on the list will
highlight it on the graph too. When an entry is selected a horizontal line is
drawn on the graph so you can visually see where that value lies compared to
other points on the graph.

By default Seohtracker will attempt to detect your locale settings, but if you
see the weights being specified in **kg** when you want them in **lb** (or vice
versa), you can force one or the other in the app preferences menu.

At the moment not much more can be done, but fear not, for more features will
come in time!

In fact, Seohtracker is open source, and if you want to contribute an idea or
report a bug, you can always use our GitHub issue tracker at

this software!
