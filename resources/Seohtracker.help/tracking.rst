Usage tracking
==============

Seohtracker for Mac records usage analytics through the software library
`SimpleCocoaGoogleAnalytics
<https://github.com/stephenlind/SimpleCocoaGoogleAnalytics>`_. Every time you
use the software usage statistics are collected and sent anonymously to
http://www.google.com/analytics. No personal information is collected, just
generic information like country of use or number of times the application is
opened.

Having this information helps to direct development.  However, if you don't
like this, you can disable usage tracking statistics in the application's
preference pane. Seohtracker will then refrain from sending any usage
statistics and will keep working without any problems.
